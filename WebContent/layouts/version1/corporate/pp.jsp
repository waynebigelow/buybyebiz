			<h4>1. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h4>
			<p>
				${application.name} is the sole custodian of the information collected on this site. ${application.name} does not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 
				${application.name} does not collect personal information from its users except when the user knowingly provides such information.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Any posting made while using the site and services can be viewed by the public and therefore is not considered "personal information" or "Personally Identifiable Information" and is not the type of information 
				protected by this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			
			<h4>2. CONTACT INFORMATION</h4>
			<p>
				${application.name} accepts name and email address information about you via it's registration process. This information may be used to contact you in order to communicate with you regarding 
				our site and services.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			
			<h4>3. SHARING</h4>
			<p>
				${application.name} does not sell, trade, or rent information to others. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information about you under the following circumstances:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the course of operating the business, it may be necessary for us to provide access to your Personally Identifiable Information to others such as our service providers and contractors so that we can 
				operate the site and our business. Where practical, we will seek to obtain confidentiality agreements consistent with this Privacy Policy that limit others' use or disclosure of the information you have shared.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We may share your Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to:
			</p>
			
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

				<li>protect, enforce, and defend our Terms of Use, rights and property;</li>
				<li>protect against misuse or unauthorized use of this site;</li>
				<li>protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be 
				disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.)</li>
			</ol>
			<hr/>
			
			<h4>4. PRIVACY ALERT</h4>
			<p>
				Your own use of the site may disclose personal information or Personally Identifiable Information to the public. For example:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This site makes business information, photos and other information to our service available for viewing by all our visitors unless the listing owner (Administrator) chooses
				to restrict public access. Please remember that any information disclosed on a non-restricted service becomes public information and may be collected and used by others without our knowledge. 
				You therefore should exercise caution when disclosing any personal information or Personally Identifiable Information in these forums.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you post Personally Identifiable Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Such activities are beyond the control of ${application.name} 
				and this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			
			<h4>5. SECURITY</h4>
			<p>
				This site takes every precaution to protect user information. When users submit sensitive information via the site, the information is protected both online and off-line.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				All user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in ${application.name} offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job 
				(for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on company security and privacy practices. 
				The servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We occasionally may obtain IP addresses from users depending upon how you access our site. IP addresses, browser, and session information may be used for various purposes, including to help 
				administer this site and diagnose and prevent service or other technology problems related to this site. This information also may be used to estimate the total number of users visiting the site from 
				specific geographical areas, to help determine which users have access privileges to certain content or services that we offer, and to monitor and prevent fraud and abuse. IP addresses are not linked to 
				Personally Identifiable Information.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			
			<h4>6. LINKS</h4>
			<p>
				This site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ${application.name} is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			
			<h4>7. COOKIES</h4>
			<p>
				A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on this site. 
				Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on this site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while 
				on this site. ${application.name} may use cookies on this site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use this site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Other web sites that are linkable from this site (e.g. business websites) may use cookies, but ${application.name} has no access to, or control over, these cookies.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			
			<h4>8. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h4>
			<p>
				${application.name} reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time without prior notice. Those changes will be posted on the site so users are always aware of what information is collected 
				and how it is used. If at any point ${application.name} decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, ${application.name} will notify 
				users via this policy statement. ${application.name} will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
